       "'The story is derived from \"King Lear\"; the setting is a farm in Iowa. Here\\'s a test for this kind of thing: if you find yourself asking, \"Why did so-and-so do such-and-such,\" and the answer is, \"because that\\'s what happened in \\'King Lear\\',\" you know that the film has failed. Well, that IS what happens here. The father figure in this story isn\\'t living his own life, he\\'s mimicking a fictional one. But there\\'s more wrong with the film than this.<br /><br />Jocelyn Moorhouse is ambitious - far more ambitious than I think she realises. She\\'s trying to take the King Lear story and completely change the setting. This is a task in itself. The likeliest result is that the transplanted story will die, and nobody will quite be able to work out why (although there are enough successful transplants, like \"West Side Story\", to make it worth trying). But she\\'s ALSO attempting a revisionist retelling. In the version of \"King Lear\" she wishes to create, Reagan and Goneril command our sympathy, and Cordelia is a villain. This is a task in itself, too.<br /><br />Succeeding at either task is hard; succeeding at both at once is impossible. In fact, succeeding at one while so much as attempting the other, is impossible. If we are to look on the very same events from a different moral perspective then the events must BE the very same events - which means there can be no tampering with setting. If the story is to be transplanted, alive, into a different setting, its moral heart must keep beating the whole while - which means there can be no tampering with ethical perspective. Moorhouse was bound to fail in not just one but in both of her endeavours. And so she did. ...Naturally, it\\'s possible to attempt both tasks, fail at both tasks, yet by some fluke hit upon a work of art that\\'s good for independent reasons. I mention this because I haven\\'t read Jane Smiley\\'s novel, which, for all I know, IS good for independent reasons. But the film isn\\'t. If there was nothing else wrong with it, there would still be no getting around the fact that it\\'s just so thoroughly, excruciatingly DULL. The very fields of corn are even more boring than they would be in real life - which needn\\'t be the case, since off the top of my head I can think of four films (\"The Wizard of Oz\", \"North by Northwest\", \"The Straight Story\", \"Kikujiro\") in which the cornfields aren\\'t boring at all.'"

    "The first step is to clean up each review so that it is reduced to literally just a 'bag of words' that can then be used to construct a fixed-length TF-IDF vector.  Details of this are discussed in (M) Chapter 8 and in my previous video.  You should expect to learn things about (1) [python string methods](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp), (2) the [python re package](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_regex.asp), in particular the \".sub()\" and \".split()\" methods, and (3) the [NLTK toolkit] (https://www.nltk.org/), in particular its list of stop words and its various stemmers and lemmatizers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are things that you should consider doing to each review (in no particular order):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert it all to lower case\n",
    "2. strip out all punctuation and HTML code (and contractions?)\n",
    "3. Remove all numbers\n",
    "4. Remove stop words--words that are so common they don't distinguish them in any way\n",
    "5. Perform stemming or lemmatization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** These last two steps create *lists* of words that you will have to join this list back together to make a single string.  The syntax will look something like:\n",

    "\n",
    "Google 'python join list into string' for more details.\n",
